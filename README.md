With the continuous development of the economy, science and technology continues to progress, and increasing people's living standards, it is the home environment, home security and other aspects also put forward higher requirements, STM32-based home security system is precisely for this circumstances.  
The system uses a STM32 chip controller, through the human body infrared module, MQ-2 smoke gas sensor module sensor body and smoke, When the human body infrared sensor and MQ-2 smoke sensor module detects abnormal, STM32 chip trigger the buzzer alarm also through the GSM module send relevant information to the user's mobile phone. Through the human body infrared, MQ-2 Smoke and temperature sensor data acquisition module, taking processed data referred to the STM32 , implement a simple home security functionality.
Security system in the home, has a simple structure, high stability, scalability, and other advantages. It can be widely used home, warehouse, residential security and other important areas.
